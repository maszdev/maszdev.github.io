Marcin Szwebs - data scientist with strong telecom background. 

I do research on 4G/5G networks and their users. Results are used to plan new Radio Acess Network features (or to make decisions not to start working on them :-) ). 

This is how I imagine good data science output: good story which

- brings understanding of the phenomenon 
- inspires 
- discovers patterns and regularities from the sea of chaos 

Everything is about the good **data storytelling**.
